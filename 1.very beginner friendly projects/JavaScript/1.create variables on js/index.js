// This is a comment in Js. Here you can add some notes that will not be shown nor treated in the code. It is just to help the coder to not forget some details
// The variable can be declared in 4 ways:

// 1.using var:
var x = 5;

// 2.using let:
let y = 7;

// 3.using const:
const pi=3.1415926;

// 4.automatically:
z = (x+y)*pi;

//to print something into the console you run the following code:
console.log(z)
console.log(`the final result is ${z}`);
z++;
// ++ means we want to increment 1 to z that means : z++ = z+1
console.log(`The value of z after increment= ${z}`);
z--;
// -- means we want to decrement 1 from z that means : z-- = z-1
console.log(`The value of z after decrement= ${z}`);
console.log("Have a nice day!")
// As you see, when we want to print a variable only, we only write its name,if we want to print a simple sentence, we write it inside "...", however, when we want to print a sentence containig a variable, we write the whole sentence inside `...`and the variable inside ${...}
