            Hello guys, I hope you are doing well.<br /> We have written this paragraph inside the paragraph tag , we have broken the previous line using the line break void element.
            <hr /> The line is also a void element that we can add to our page. And in the end, we can add an input area to give the use the ability to communicate with the page like below 
            <br /><input />
